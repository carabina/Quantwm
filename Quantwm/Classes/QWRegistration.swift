  /*
   Collector Registration:
   - Collected Set
   - Collector Counter

   Rule:
   - If any property of the Collected set is modified, then Collector counter is incremented.
   - Collector Counter can be incremented without Collected set update (update of non monitored property).
   - Once a notification with Collector-Read has been sent, no change to the Collected set is allowed

   Subscription as Write:
   - Collected Set is included in the registration Read Set
   - Collector property is included in the WrittenSet

   Subscription as Read:
   - Collected Set is included as properties which can be read, but do not need to be registered.
   - Collector property is part of the read set

   ** Active Collector **
   - Any component updating a property of the read set shall increment the collector.

   Scheduling:
   - Hard scheduling:
   - No need to declare it in write
   - Smart Scheduling:
   - Registration can declare the collectorPath in write or read
   - The collector level is computed based on collectorPath level.


   ** Passive Collector **
   - Collector is scheduled as a normal Processing in Smart scheduling.
   with read and write set
   - On activation, the incrementClosure is performed.
   - This is a regular registration, with a closure instead of a selector
   -> Need to replace selector by closure

   Scheduling:

   Step 1:
   - Define a QWCollector object
   Step 2:
   - Register a QWCollector object
